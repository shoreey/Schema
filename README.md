# 🧬 Clinical Database Schema Reference

This repository provides **visual schema representations** of three widely used UK-based clinical databases: **CPRD GOLD**, **CPRD AURUM**, and **BADBIR**.

Each schema is available in both **PDF** and **image (JPG)** formats, making it easy for researchers and analysts to reference the structure of these datasets visually.
